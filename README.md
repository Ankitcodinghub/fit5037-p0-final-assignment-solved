3 Scenario for the Assignment

This task entails designing and executing a network that spans across the three Monash campuses, utilizing GNS3. The networkâ€™s architecture should prioritize security considerations. Your design should establish interconnectivity between the three campuses leveraging the perimeter firewalls or routers present. While an illustrative example of a topology configuration file has been provided, it remains incomplete. You can use your own network toplogy if you would like, Mikrotik documentation can be found here: https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/. Please use the following command to download the example configuration file:

â€¢ All campuses must have at least one perimeter firewall/router.

â€¢ All campuses must have a Client LAN, each LAN should contain at least one client container.

â€¢ The network must have the following servers: DNS, CA (Certificate Authority), FTP, SSH, WEB, MAIL and VPN (this is for external clients connecting to Monash VPN). Servers can be placed in any campus(es). Itâ€™s assumed that the network is connected to the internet (can be shown using cloud in GNS3).

â€¢ Assign different subnets to campuses and configure perimeter firewalls/routers.

â€¢ For the DNS, FTP, SSH, WEB and MAIL servers, any open-source servers can be installed. Using lab material is also fine. CA can just be a normal container. Installation/Configuration of VPN server is not required, a normal container can be used for this as well, you can assume that itâ€™s a SSL VPN (port 443).

â€¢ WEB and MAIL servers should use TLS with certificates issued by the CA. Use your student ID as domain name for both WEB and MAIL servers. E.g., for student ID 111222333, use 111222333.com as domain name. MAIL server should have at least two email recipients configured. Itâ€™s assumed that the client containers have CAâ€™s certificate installed.

â€¢ Perform a ping test from one campus to the other, e.g., ping from the client in the Clayton to the Peninsula, and from Peninsula to the Caulfield campus.

â€¢ For FTP, SSH, WEB and MAIL services, connect the service from one of the clients and show the connectivity.

â€¢ For TLS connection, show Wireshark capture.Assignment Project Exam Help

â€¢ For the DNS server, perform a nslookup to the domain created in above steps from one of the clients.

This is site-to-site VPN, each perimeter router will have two tunnels. For example, Caulfield perimeter router will have a VPN tunnel with Peninsula router and a tunnel with Clayton campus router. The primary goal is to ensure that all inter-campus traffic is securely protected by these VPN tunnels. (Note: this setup is not related withe VPN server which is just a container)

â€¢ WEB, MAIL, and VPN servers should be accessible to everyone, including the clients on the internet.

â€¢ WEB and VPN servers cannot initiate a connection to the internal network, they can only reply to the connection requests from the clients.

â€¢ The DNS server should only be accessible to all internal clients (no external/internet clients)

Additionally, configure the firewall according to one of the options below.

â€¢ If studentIDmod4=0:

â€“ Restrict access to the FTP server to clients located exclusively within the Clayton campus.

â€“ Restrict access to the SSH server to clients located exclusively within the Caulfield campus.

â€“ Restrict access to the MAIL server to clients located exclusively within the Peninsula campus.

â€¢ If studentIDmod4=1:

â€“ Restrict access to the MAIL server to clients located exclusively within the Clayton campus.

â€“ Restrict access to the SSH server to clients located exclusively within the Caulfield campus.

â€“ Restrict access to the FTP server to clients located exclusively within the Peninsula campus.

â€¢ If studentIDmod4=2:

â€“ Restrict access to the MAIL server to clients located exclusively within the Clayton campus.

â€“ Restrict access to the FTP server to clients located exclusively within the Caulfield campus.

â€“ Restrict access to the SSH server to clients located exclusively within the Peninsula campus.

â€¢ If studentIDmod4=3:

â€“ Restrict access to the SSH server to clients located exclusively within the Clayton campus.

â€“ Restrict access to the MAIL server to clients located exclusively within the Caulfield campus.

â€“ Restrict access to the FTP server to clients located exclusively within the Peninsula campus.

Record a video proving that the firewall rules work. First try connecting the service from a node where it

was permissible and then from a node where it was not allowed. Provide the firewall rules, from eachAssignment Project Exam Help firewall, in the report.

task. More specifically, discuss the following (no actual configuration is required for these questions, please limit your answer to under 100 words):

Provide the IDS rule configuration in the report. Demonstrate in the video a live exploitation of the vulnerabilities in Metasploitable and the IDS results.

Developing an Ethical Network Usage Policy is essential. Your task is to communicate guidelines to Monash staff and students regarding appropriate network conduct, prohibited activities, and behaviors classified as unethical. List a minimum of five policy directives. Kindly ensure your response falls within the 150 to 500 word limit.
